# flight-reservation-management

Description
The Flight Reservation System is the final project for my Java course. The main purpose is to build a flight booking website that provides passengers some functions to select their own flights and retrieve their flight information by given booking reference

Functions
Flight search: flights could be listed by destinations, date, journey (round-trip/one way) and number of passengers
Flight selection: the lowest fare on flights could be displayed or users could change the date to choose the most suitable fare
Passenger details: personal data are compulsory to enter and validate for processing the next steps
Extra services: seat map would be appeared for selection and Luggage extra section for each passenger to purchase in advance
Payment: pay later and pay now are two methods that could be choosed to make payment after reviewing a detailed itinerary. Besides, vouchers could be applied on each booking. A confirmation email would be sent
Reference retrieval: flight detailed information would be reviewed by a given booking reference. Moreover, booked flights could be cancelled or extra services would be changed by users
